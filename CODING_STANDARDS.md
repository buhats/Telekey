# Coding Standards

## Our Pledge

Documenting the coding standards used by your group can improve the quality of 
the software that you write by making it more consistent between developers. 
Coding standards should describe conventions used by the team such as where braces 
are positioned, naming conventions for classes, methods, variables, and documentation 
conventions. Many programming languages have several different published coding 
standards for that language. Your team may wish to adopt a published standard for 
the language of choice, rather than trying to develop your own. Upon the adoption 
of coding standards, all written code should be consistent with these standards.


## Our Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions
* Classes- UpperCamelCase
* Methods- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
* Variables- Variable names follow the same convention as function names.

### Indendation
* Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

### Maximum Line Length
* Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

### Imports
* Imports should usually be on separate lines:

### Comments
* All comments should be in the form of Block Comments. Inline Comments are not permitted.
